This program is for playing the battleship game. 
The player will play against the computer.
There are two boards including computer's board and player's board.
Each board has three length size ships, and the player can place two ships on his or her board.
Computer's ships will be automatically placed on its board. 
After the player finishes setting up ships, the game starts. 
The player guess computer's ships at first, and when he or she hits the ship, it will be 'H'.
When the guess is incorrect, it will be 'M'. Each board representing all results of 
their guesses is shown every time until the game is over. 
The game is over when the player or the computer hits all ships.
